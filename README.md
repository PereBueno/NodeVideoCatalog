# NodeVideoCatalog
This is a sample project, valid as a tutorial of how to use the MEAN stack, with node.js, express, mongodb (with mongoose) and Angularjs

The first tag is suppossed to contain a working copy of a simple how-to application, to later evolve into a video catalog.

It assumes the system is running node.js, so npm install will install requires node modules (angular, mongoose & express).

It also assumes mongoDB is running in the system
